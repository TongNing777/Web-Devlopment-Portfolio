I have generated ssh key before for my ECON368 Data Science for Economists class before. 

To find my local personal SSH key, run the following commands in terminal:
ls ~/.ssh

This will provide my personal key and public key:
id_rsa       → private key  
id_rsa.pub   → public key  

To view the public key:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

This is the code I used for my public ssh key:
ningtong@bobcat-027-012 ~ % cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMUBYD3vWB2Hd/m5WPlg4f2JkS/DiQDygRFQpYvu78d+ ningtong@bobcat-107-150.bates.edu

After copy the ssh key to the remote server, we can connect to a remote server by using:
ssh ningtong@catapult.bates.edu

The private key should never be shared.


scp could be used when securely upload local files to a remote web server, such as:
scp -r ./my-portfolio/* tningbat@catapult.bates.edu:/home/tningbat/public_html/
